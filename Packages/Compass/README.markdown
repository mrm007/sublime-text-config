Compass Build System for Sublime Text 2
===========================================

Adds a Build System for Compass Watch when opening SASS Files. (Sublime-Text-2-SASS-Package or similar SASS Package needed).

Create a project and place the Sublime Text Project file in your project's folder root.
Example:
    yourproject/project.sublime-project

A Sublime Text Project File in the root of your project is necessary.

PREREQUISITES
------------------------------------

Ruby and the Compass Gem have to be installed. Important: This package is not going to add syntax highlighting for SCSS/SASS.

INSTALLATION
------------------------------------

### With Package Control plugin (Recommended)

I recommend this method If you want the Compass Build System always up-to-date.

1. Install the [Package Control Plugin](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) for Sublime Text 2. Follow the instructions and restart Sublime Text 2.
2. Use Preferences > Package Control or `Command+Shift+P` (OS X) / `Control+Shift+P` (Linux/Windows) and select "Package Control: Install Package". Wait while repositories are loading.
3. When the command form appears type "Compass" and you'll find the Compass Build System. Select to install.

### Without Package Control plugin: GIT

1. Open terminal / git bash and browse to the Sublime Text Packages Folder

* OSX:

        cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages

* Windows:

        C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages

* Linux:

        ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/

2. `git clone` the repository in a Folder named "Compass". The folder have to be named Compass for the Build System to work.

        git://github.com/WhatWeDo/Sublime-Text-2-Compass-Build-System.git Compass

### Manually

1. Download the zipped package from Github

2. Browse to the Sublime Text Package folder. For Sublime Text 2 paths look like the following examples:

* OSX:

        cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages

* Windows:

        C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages

* Linux:

        ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/

3. Once that folder is open, close Sublime Text.

4. Extract the zip, rename the folder to "Compass" and move it in the package folder

5. Restart Sublime Text.

Build
------------------------------------

Open one of your .sass files and press CTRL + B (or Tools > Build). If you have more than one Build System that is able to compile SASS, change the Build System to Compass under Tools > Build.
