v0.9.1

  1) Glue now provides a default PATH string based upon assignment with the Python os.environ['PATH'] attribute.  This should prevent Linux & Windows users from having to touch the settings file in order to get started with Glue. Mac OSX users may still need to modify their PATH setting in the `Glue Settings - User` JSON file.  It's an issue on the Sublime Text side...sorry.

  2) Prefer zsh or bash? You can now set your default shell with the "glue_shellpath" setting in the `Glue Settings - User` JSON file. Use the filepath as the value in this JSON setting.

Kudos:
Thanks to @FichteFoll on GitHub for the feature request that led to #1
