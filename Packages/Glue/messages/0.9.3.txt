v0.9.3

Updated Command:

○ `glue browse` : if you use a local file path as an argument (instead of a URL), Glue will open the file in your default browser.  It's a quick and easy way to view project HTML documents in your browser. Here's an example for a project that contains a `html` directory:

    $ glue browse html/index.html

 URL still work with the `glue browse` command and will open your default browser at the requested URL.

New Commands:

○ `glue finder [path]` : reveal the current working directory (default) or optional [path] in the finder. Navigate to a different working directory with the `cd` command on all platforms.  See the documentation for more information :: http://gluedocs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/navigation.html
○ `glue localhost [port]` : open your default browser to http://localhost:8000 by default or to http://localhost:<port> if you include a port argument


Bug Fixes:

○ Remove carriage returns from standard output returned to Glue.  This eliminates the displayed CR characters that were showing up in the standard output from some applications.
