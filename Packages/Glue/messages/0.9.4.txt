You just got a new tub of Glue!

CHANGELOG

v0.9.4

New Command

○ `glue goto <query>` - use the Sublime Text Goto Anything feature with a Glue command.  Enter part of a filename or directory then submit it.  You will receive a list of matching project files.  In the text input box that opens, add # and additional text to query inside the file, @ and additional text to jump to symbols, and : with additional numeral to jump to a line number in the file.  See the Sublime Text documentation for details on the Goto Anything features.

Updated Command

○ cd command - added the `cd ~` idiom that will allow you to navigate to your user home directory on all platforms (issue #5)

Bug Fixes

○ Fixed exception that was raised when you enter an empty command string (issue #11)

Kudos:
- Great big thanks to Andy Dai for the pull request that addressed issue #11
- Thanks to Jwahar Bammi for the request that brought about this new feature (issue #5).
