Sorry to interrupt
==================

First of all, thanks for installing sublime-gulp!

You can start using it now by choosing 'Gulp' from your command pallete or selecting one of the available snippets.

If you want to know a bit more of what you can do with the package you can:

* Check the package settings on Preference -> Package Settings -> Gulp -> Settings - Default

* Take a look at the README at: https://github.com/NicoSantangelo/sublime-gulp
