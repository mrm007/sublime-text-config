Recent Changes
==============

Good news, you're now using the version 3.0.0 of the Gulp package!. A bunch of stuff changed if you have any troubles you can report it on github.com/NicoSantangelo/sublime-gulp/issues

If you are in a hurry and something is not working, you can replace your Gulp package (Browse Packages -> Gulp folder) with v2.1.2 from github.com/NicoSantangelo/sublime-gulp/releases

New features/changes:

* Now the package shows the STDERR output, meaning that if your task fails you'll see the output

* Gulp: Show panel command. This command will simply reopen the panel (not tab), it's just for convenience.
  You can map it to a shortcut with 'gulp_show_panel'

* Gulp (silent) command. Now you can run a gulp task without showing the panel/tab.
  Using the setting show_silent_errors you can control if you want the panel/tab to appear if the task errors out

* New setting: results_autoclose_timeout_in_milliseconds.
  You can set the time the panel/tab will stay open after the task finished (if it's 0, the default value, it will stay open)

* Syntax highlighting! Now the panel/tab has some colors inspired in the terminal output of gulp.
  If you don't like it or you want to use your own syntax file, you can modify the syntax setting (you may need a ST restart)

* Now the package has some more status messages to let you know what's happening


That's all!, thanks a lot to @KevinBatdorf and @Sigmus for the suggestions and help.
