Recent Changes
==============

Hello!

The lastest version of sublime-gulp now has experimental support for gulp4.0-alpha!

If you tried to list the tasks using the gulp4.0, try removing the `.sublime-gulp.cache` file (you can use `Gulp: Delete cache`) and running `Gulp` again.

If you find any problem or you have a feature request please let me know at https://github.com/NicoSantangelo/sublime-gulp/issues

Thanks a lot to @Smuliii for the heads up!
