# JavaScript.tmLanguage
Better JavaScript language definition for TextMate and SublimeText. This builds on the language files commonly used and adds more fine grained matching and also includes new features from ECMAScript 6 like modules, succinct methods, arrow functions, classes, generators, and accessors (ES5).

## Installation and Use

If you haven't already, [install Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation), then select `JavaScript Next` from the `Package Control: Install Package` dropdown list in the Command Palette.

To set this as your default JavaScript syntax, open a javascript file, then select `View -> Syntax -> Open all with current extension as... -> JavascriptNext`.
