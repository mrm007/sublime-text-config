# MarkdownEditing 2.0.0 Changelog

This is a major release for MarkdownEditing. In this document, you will find information about the update.

This release adds a syntax file for __GitHub flavored Markdown__ and makes it default for Markdown extensions (md, txt).

Sublime text has a native tiny package for Markdown. However, when MarkdownEditing is enabled, native package causes some conflicts. For this reason, MarkdownEditing will automatically disable it. Since it doesn't bring anything new over MarkdownEditing, this is not a loss. But remember, when you disable/remove MarkdownEditing, you have to reenable the native one manually (if you want).

It's suggested you take a look at `Packages\MarkdownEditing\README.md` file.

Feedback is always welcome. MarkdownEditing is hosted on https://github.com/ttscoff/MarkdownEditing/. What features would you like to see in the next version?

## Notable Features

* Dark and yellow themes added. In order to enable them, put one of these lines in `Packages\User\Markdown.sublime-settings`:
    `"color_scheme": "Packages/MarkdownEditing/MarkdownEditor-Dark.tmTheme"`
    `"color_scheme": "Packages/MarkdownEditing/MarkdownEditor-Yellow.tmTheme"`
* Option to keep current line centered as writing goes on. Check `Packages\MarkdownEditing\Markdown.sublime-settings` file to see how to enable it.
* Better highlighting for blockquotes.
* Improved symbol list (Ctrl+R).
    - More readable indentation
    - Shows underlined headers, too
* Grey out only tag parts in XML/HTML tags, not the whole content.
* Many syntax improvements and bug fixes.
* More powerful bolding/italicizing.
    - If there is no selection, it will apply it to the word under the cursor.
    - It won't re-apply bold/italic if it already is.
    - It will convert to _italic_ with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>I</kbd> even if it is __bold__ at that moment and vice versa.

## GitHub flavored Markdown Specific Features

* Syntax highlighting in fenced code blocks.
* GitHub style strikethrough (`~~`).
* Underscores in snake case words doesn't make it italic.
* Highlights `<kbd>` tag differently.

## Changes

* _Bold_ and _italic_ keybindings are changed to <kbd>Ctrl+B</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl+I</kbd> respectively. This won't affect your other commands assigned to these keybindings for other scopes.
* `_` is used instead of `*` for bold/italic. In a future version, it is planned to be configurable.
