# MarkdownEditing 2.0.1 Changelog

Your _MarkdownEditing_ plugin is updated. Enjoy new version. For any type of feedback you can use [GitHub issues][issues].

## Bug Fixes

* When autocomplete popup is visible, pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> now always inserts the autocomplete item. Previously, if the cursor was for example in a list, <kbd>Enter</kbd> was inserting new list item ignoring the active autocomplete popup.
* Symbols in fenced code blocks will no longer be displayed in the symbol list (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>R</kbd>).

## New Features

* Markdown headers will be displayed in the Project Symbol List (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>R</kbd>). They will start with `#`, so you will know they belong to markdown files at a glance. Also they will be on top of the list because of the presedence of `#`.
* Bold and italic markers are configurable now. Follow `Preferences > Package Settings > Markdown Editing` in the menu. See README for further help.
