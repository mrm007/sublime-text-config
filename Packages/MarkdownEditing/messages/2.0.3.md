# MarkdownEditing 2.0.3 Changelog

Your _MarkdownEditing_ plugin is updated. Enjoy new version. For any type of feedback you can use [GitHub issues][issues].

## Bug Fixes

* "Gather missing links" feature was broken in ST3, fixed.
* "Fix Underlined Headers" feature was broken in ST3, fixed (thanks to @gillibrand).
* A bug related to link definitions was causing CPU hanging. Fixed. ([#111][], [#112][])
* Link and email address detection improved.

## New Features

* "Gather missing links" feature is now more intelligent
* Command palette items improved
* Ctrl+B and Ctrl+I will unbold / unitalicize words without selecting them if they are already bold / italic. Cursor can be at anywhere of the word. Applies only to `_` style bolds / italics. This is because ST word selection (Ctrl+D) doesn't include `*` characters.
* Link and email address highlighting improved.

## Changes

* These files are renamed. If you have used them in your user keymap file, you need to update them.
    - `macros/Make Word Bold.sublime-macro`     -> `macros/Transform Word - Bold.sublime-macro`
    - `macros/Make Word Italic.sublime-macro`   -> `macros/Transform Word - Italic.sublime-macro`
