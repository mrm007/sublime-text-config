Sublimerge has just been upgraded to version 2.7.6. 

It is highly recommended to restart Sublime Text before use.
------------------------------------------------------------


What's new?
===========

1. Guessing shell fallback encoding
   Previous version introduced a new setting - `shell_fallback_encoding` which is used
   when could not properly run shell commands because of encoding problems. Now before
   this setting is used, Sublimerge automatically tries to guess correct encoding if
   default one fails.

2. Better Edit Mode Enter/Leave
   When entering/leaving Edit Mode there is no more view "jump"

3. Registration problem in ST3
   Fixed registration problem in ST3 on some computers

Licensing
=========
