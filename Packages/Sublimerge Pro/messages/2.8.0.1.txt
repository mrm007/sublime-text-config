What's new?
===========

1. 3-way diff for conflicts resolution
   Sublimerge can be used as a merge tool for Git/SVN/Mercurial and others. THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL
   FEATURE SO BE AWARE THAT IT MAY NOT WORK PERFECTLY.

2. Renamed commands
   All occurences of 'Difference' have been replaced with 'Change', i.e. 'Go to Previous Change'

3. New commands:
   - `Go to Next Conflict`
   - `Go to Previous Conflict`

4. Performance improvements
   Diff blocks are now displayed a little bit faster.

5. Improved scroll synchronization
   Now the diff view's panels are synchronized almost immediately. However, depending on your
   computer, they may lag sometimes.

6. Handling multiple instances
   Sublimerge can now run many parallel instances of diff windows.

7. New settings:
   - `diff_block_conflict`    - color used to draw conflicting regions

   - `three_way_navigate_all`      - defines how to navigate through changes in 3-way diff view. When
                                     set to `false` navigation is performed on conflicts only (this is
                                     the default). It can be changed for current diff session from
                                     Context menu too.

   - `auto_merge_simple_conflicts` - Tries to automatically resolve simple conflicts in 3-way diff.
                                     When set to `false` all conflicts will be reported and left to be
                                     resolved by you.

   - `three_way_layout`            - defines layout type for three-way diff view

   - `three_way_merged_height`     - percentage height of merged pane when `three_way_layout` = 1

   - `go_to_next_after_merge`      - defines whether should view automatically go to the next change
                                     after merging previous one.

   - `git_global_args`             - additional arguments used for all git commands except `git log`
                                     and `git show`.

   - `svn_global_args`             - the same as above, but for `svn` command

   - `hg_global_args`              - the same as above, but for `hg` command

   - `scroll_sync_interval`        - previously `scroll_sync_defer`. Defines how often, in milliseconds,
                                     diff panels should be synchronized. Defaults to 1, but change it to
                                     a greater value if you experience performance/stability problems.

  8. New Custom Comparisons variables:
     - {git} - shorthand for `{config:git_executable_path} {config:git_global_args}`
     - {svn} - shorthand for `{config:svn_executable_path} {config:svn_global_args}`
     - {hg} - shorthand for `{config:hg_executable_path} {config:hg_global_args}`

  9. Custom Comparisons: ability to run more steps after `compare` step.
     Now the `compare` step is not the final one. You can now define more steps which will be executed
     after the diff view is closed.
