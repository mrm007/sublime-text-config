Sublimerge has just been upgraded to version 2.8.2

It is highly recommended to restart Sublime Text before use.
------------------------------------------------------------


What's new?
===========

1. Fixed commands `Compare to Other Branch...`, `Compare to Named Branch...`
   These Custom Comparison commands were failing when branch name contained slash.

2. Fixed displaying `CR` or `LF` in ST3</title>
   Fixed issue in Sublime Text 3 that caused displaying `CR` or `LF` characters in some cases.
   
3. Fixed 3-way auto-merge algorithm
   There was a bug that caused a line, immediately following an empty block, to be gone in 
   pre-merged output. This happened only when empty block was selected to be a part of 
   pre-merged output and it was the last change block.


Licensing
=========

If you like Sublimerge, please support development by buying a license. It doesn't cost much! :)
