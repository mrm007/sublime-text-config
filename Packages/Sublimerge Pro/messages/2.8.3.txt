Sublimerge has just been upgraded to version 2.8.3

It is highly recommended to restart Sublime Text before use.
------------------------------------------------------------


What's new?
===========

1. Fixed 3-way auto-merge algorithm
   There was a bug that could sometimes lead to duplicate lines in automatically
   merged content.

2. Nicer directories' diff view
   The view has now dedicated syntax highlighting so that is much more colorful 
   and readable. It should automatically adjust to user's color scheme.


Licensing
=========

If you like Sublimerge, please support development by buying a license. It doesn't cost much! :)
