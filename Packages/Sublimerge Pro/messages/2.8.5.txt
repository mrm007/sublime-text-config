It is highly recommended to restart Sublime Text before use.

What's new?
===========

Bug Fixes:
  - Workaround for ST's bug causing freeze of one of the views in diff window. When an unsaved 
    file was compared with clipboard or snapshot, the view containing that file was frozen.
    In that state it was not displaying differences and was unscrollable.


Licensing
=========

If you like Sublimerge, please support development by buying a license. It doesn't cost much! :)
