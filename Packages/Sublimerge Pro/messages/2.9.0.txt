What's new?
===========

Bug fixes:
  - Fix for navigation problems after merge in three-way diff view.
    There was a bug that made it impossible to navigate through changes after all conflicts have been resolved.

  - Properly disable 'Go to Next Change' and 'Go to Previous Change'.
    When diff view is in Edit Mode these commands have nothing to do and are now disabled.

  - Fixed "OSError: [WinError 6] The handle is invalid" exception.
    On some Windows boxes above exception has been thrown while running subprocess for VCS commands.


Enhancements:
  - Context key bindings
    Simplified keyboard shortcuts to make Sublimerge usage even easier and more friendly.

  - Optimized file save
    All change blocks are now removed faster in order to save the output file.

  - Enhanced scroll sync
    Removed possible sync delay while scrolling the view by navigating through changes by keyboard. Also changed
    positioning algorithm to show the maximum content of a change if it exceeds viewport height.

  - Command Palette enhancements
    Added 'Sublimerge' and 'Sublimerge: Differences Navigator' commands to Sublime's Command Palette


New features:
  - New setting: view / highlight_line
    You can use 'highlight_line' setting to highlight active corresponding lines in diff panels.
    By default set to 'true'.
